# Overview

I am trying to increase my familiarity with the React Native framework for developing mobile apps. The end goal of this app is to allow users to create and manage characters for a popular boardgame. This branch focuses on the usage of AsyncStorage allowing persistant data to remain between uses.
Using the onscreen buttons and forms, users will be able to add, edit, and delete characters.
